# YOLOv3 facial expressions detector
This is the implementation of custom YOLOv3-Tiny architecture in Tensorflow 2.0.0. The whole pipeline was designed to detect multiple faces on photo/video with their facial expressions in realtime with CPU. It was written as a part of my diploma work and pushed to github only to proof that it exists :).
